# LoL-Builds
This skin uses the **[op.gg](op.gg)** champion build guides to show you what items are best for your favorite champion in League of Legends.

Simply enter the name of your desired **champion** and your preferred **lane** and the most important items, runes and skill order will be shown.

### Note:
The champion name has to be **spelled correctly**, but use of capital and small initial letters doesn't matter.

A variant to **auto-detect** your currently played champion is also included, just enter your **region** and **summoner name** in the Summoner.inc file in the Resources folder and your currently played champion will be detected as soon as you enter the loading screen.
